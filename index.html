                    Thalia's lustrum is of course also about innovation, that is why we are introducing the legendary 12-12-12 event! A prosecco brunch, borrel, dinner and party in one. Starting at 12, ending at 12 and taking 12 hours. And as if that was not enough, there is also an awesome motto to it, and what else could that be instead of THALIA! So wear all your merch from Thalia, whether it is committee shirt, intro shirt, sweat pants or sunglasses, get it all out of the closet and show it off to the rest of the world! This is of course also an amazing chance to show off your brand new lustrum merchandise you surely bought ;)<br>
                    The borrel will take place at the professor where we will start off with a prosecco brunch until 14:00. After that we will borrel and have some dinner to get ready for the party ahead. The party is open for everyone and tickets will be sold separately online. You need a ticket to get in but once you are inside you can exchange your tickets for consumption coins. The party will start at 12 and end at 12, making the event take an astonishing 12 hours.

                    Thalia gotcha game with a twist, every participant gets assigned a watergun and a target (another participant). The goal is to assassinate your target with this watergun. Instead of being permanently eliminated after getting killed, the dead will be resurrected daily. After every successful kill, you recieve some points + a new target. More kills = more points! The person with the most points at the end of the week recieves a prize. More rules will follow, but in principle this game can be played at any place throughout the whole lustrum week, so keep you guard up!

                    The spring is florishing as ever and the summer is around the corner, all you want to do is have a nice time outside and enjoy the beautiful weather. What better way to enjoy this weather than to go supping with your fellow Thalians during an amazing Lustrum event on a peaceful Sunday afternoon. Supping is a nice activity where you are canooing on a surf board, almost like a Venetian gondolier but without any anoying tourist in your boat.

                    What is a Lustrum without a Cantus, and not just a cantus but a special Cantus since we will have our Cantus on the grandstand of the Goffert Stadium. Would you like to sing till your throat is sore? Do you like to strengthen your friendships with other Thalians to the point that you are brothers and sisters? And would you like to do this while drinking some beer with the Praesidium and having a great laugh? Well then this event is most definitely something for you! From 19:00-19:30 is a walk-in, at 19:30 the Cantus will start.

During this event, you will be a member of a team of 2 or 3 people, with whom you are going to try to solve a very fun and challenging task! This task consists of creating a bot that will attempt to win a game. After every team creates their own bot, we will host a tournament where the bots get to 'fight' other bots! The team that created the best bot wins the tournament! The event will be in the Giga-Bite, where the live event scores will be projected on the big screen. Furthermore, there will be live commentary and lots of snacks and drinks. We hope to see all of you at this amazing event! The website we will use is <a href="https://www.aigaming.com/" class="link">www.aigaming.com</a>. We will announce the chosen game a week in advance, so that enthousiastic participants can already get a head start.

You will be able to compete in six different tournaments during the entire evening. The tournament will consist of three rounds with two games each.

                    The three rounds are scheduled as followed:<br>
                    18:00-19:30: Just Dance & League of Legends<br>
                    20:00-21:30: Mario Kart & Minecraft<br>
                    22:00-23:30: Super Smash Bros & Rocket League<br><br>
                    Just Dance, Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros will be played on a Wii/Wii-U/Nintendo Switch. For League of Legends, Minecraft and Rocket League you will have to bring your own laptop. Network switches will obviously be provided. We hope to see you at the tournament! GL&HF!

                    We all know it, we all love it and we have all joked about living there. Our beloved Mercator. So instead of always just using it as our "working" space, let's make it our home for one night. This event will be like those good old times, when you were young and innocent and just had a sleepover with your best friends. We will watch movies, play fun games and eat snacks all evening. So put on your PJs, bring your blankets and pillows and get cozy for an evening in all our homes. Can't wait to see you there!
